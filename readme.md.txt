Technologies used for development:
1) HTML5
2) jQuery
3) Bootstrap
4) FourSquare API

How it works:

This project,Search Venues, takes the Name of the place by the user and returns the Recommended and popular places near by the location entered. This process is executed when the user enters the Name of a place and hits the Submit button.  

The Search Venues Page, has a Search Panel on the top mid of the screen and filters by categories on the left side of the page. Whereas the results of the desired location are shown on the right side of the page. 
 (This name based search is done by hitting venues/search on foursquare API as per foursquare documentation.)
